# Day 31 - 10 Feb 2022

## Yesterday left over
1. work on sequence â­•

## Problem:
1. Sequence
   1. try to think of removing rather than traversals
   2. try to list choice (some dynamic programming technique)
   3. try to determine state

## Some side knowledge
1. Java 9 -> list.of() -> unmodifiableList (immutable)
2. Immutable in java8 -> Collection.unmodifiableList

## Things to do next
1. work on next question
