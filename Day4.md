#Day 4 - 5 Jan 2022

##Thing to do tmr
1. understand leftshift and right shift❌  
2. refine the algorithm of String Compression❌  
3. Study a bit dynamic programming⭕  
4. finish Chapter 1⭕  

##CCI or LC Problems  
###Rotate Matrix  
◦ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJJp6QLLXYE  
◦ try to deduce the math formula after identifying the pattern  
◦ Why length/2 as layer,  n-2i - 1 for column shifting -> can be identify in listing and see the relationship
###Zero Matrix
◦   followed the idea from  
‣   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfIPlE2y98o  
◦   High space complexity, low time complexity  
◦   Boolean row and column willl be better  
◦   identify critical row and column situation
◦  Separate row and column for deducing the result
###String rotation
◦ Easy  
◦ join itself to check substring  
◦ brain twister
