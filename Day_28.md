# Day 28 - 6 Feb 2022

## Yesterday left over
1. Study topological sort and do problem on itâ­•

## Problem:
1. Build order
   1. Topological Sort
   2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL-KzMXSXXI
   3. implement with kahn algorithm
   4. time -> O(V+E)
   5. based on bfs
   6. dfs will have stack problem but should have same time complexity

## Things to do next
1. Study topological sort and do problem on it
