# Day 38 - 23 Feb 2022

## Yesterday left over
1. Path finding algorithm❌
2. leetcode problem - Number of Islands❌

## Leetcode problem:
1. TwoSum
   1. simple hashmap solution
   2. dp can use hashmap for caching
2. Three Sum
   1. Came up a without sorting solution but exceeded the time complexity
   2. think of how to separate calculated and not calculated
   3. set.add -> boolean to determine whether added or not
   4. two pointer for sorted solution
   
## Things to do next
1. Path finding algorithm
2. leetcode problem - Number of Islands2. leetcode problem - Number of Islands
